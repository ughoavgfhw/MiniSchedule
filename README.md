# MiniSchedule

MiniSchedule is a simple, menu bar app. It allows quick access to the events in your iCal calendars.

## Features

- Choose which calendars to show events from
- Specify a time frame for which events to show
    - Today, tomorrow, the next 12/24 hours, or a custom date
- Events show time, event title, and location
- View events in the menu or via a popup window

## Planned

- Ability to change the hotkey for the popup window  
  <small>(‚åÉS is incredibly inconvenient, but it was the best I could think of as a default)</small>
- Automatically resize the menu to fit longer events
    - Or at least handle long events better than clipping them
- More flexibility in the shown time range
